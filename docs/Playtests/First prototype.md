### Questions

Most frustrating point of the game?

"First round RNG can fuck you over, not being able to move/remove towers was kind of frustrating but it's starting to grow on me"

Favorite thing about the game?

"The AOE attack cards are really cool, they make the game distinct from other tower defense games"

What did you think of the difficulty?

"Difficult but not impossible"

Anything to add remove or change?

"More cards, variety of stuff and unique things you can do. Something that blocks the enemies and forces them to change path. Starting deck could be customized, or set and the random"

Anything else you want to say about this?
