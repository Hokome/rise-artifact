## Bugs

Blaze appears twice when bugging, so it's probably a controller problem

Sentry not being placed even though it's on the light gray squares (last column)

## Kanarch

- She understood how to use upgrades immediately
- Lots of unused power, maybe emphasise it more?
- Doesn't look at card descriptions
- I didn't say you get power every round
- "You should put right click to cancel in the tutorial" (maybe the bug comes from this)
- Tower placement is iffy, maybe I should make it more leanient
- She often kind of gives up even when she has power left?
- She didn't understand how power goes up
- Biggest issue seems to be noticing how much power she's got
- "Oh I'm so good" after hitting two enemies with one strike
- "Does that one regenerate??"
- Frustrated with targeting
- "I have no turret?"
- This turret is so underwhelming
- So uhh, the game is really hard, but it seems she's kind of having fun. She's losing health every round.
- She's upgrading both sentries
- The cards are getting in the way when hovered while placing cards
- "You should make an animation for when an enemy reaches the base"

What was the most frustrating part of the game?

"I think the green enemy regain health too fast"

What was the best part of the game?

"Probably strategizing and using all the upgrades"

Add, change or remove?

"Make the early game easier. More indication of when something dies"

What did you think of the difficulty?

"It was pretty hard, I think it would be fun if it was later in the game"

Fun 0 - 10?

"7"

Nothing to add
