## Starter cards

Overall, starter cards are fairly weak for their cost (both in draw and power) so that the player is encouraged to take more cards in their deck. It also teaches the main mechanics of the game, building, modifying buildings, and using attacks.

### Deploy sentry

This serves as an introduction to building cards and buildings/sentries in general. They are also necessary to scale with the starter deck, as upgrades cannot function without them.

### Upgrade

This introduces upgrades and to an extent building status effects. It also allows exponential scaling, as the increased damage is augmented with the attack speed. It does require a building in order to be useful, but since there is only two of them in the starter deck, the player is guaranteed to get at least 2 useful cards alongside it.

### Strike

This card serves as a cheap damage card, along with [[#Blast]] it can help killing important targets faster or even instantly, can also prevent a few health lost if used on smaller enemies in the early rounds.

### Blast

This is generally more powerful than [[#Strike]] thanks to its increased radius, it helps a lot in the early rounds if there isn't enough firepower, being able to solo most of them.

## Building cards

These cards should have a bit more specialty (like applying stuff to the built sentry) but for now they are just a way to get other buildings.

## Status cards

These cards introduce status effects and sentry aspects.

### Blaze

This can be an incredibly powerful attack if paired with other burn sources, and also is a good introduction to burn status effect.

### Blizzard

This should introduce the slow mechanic and allow for some enemies to be heavily slowed down for a while. Because its effect isn't as strong as a [[#Blaze]], it is cheaper.

### Hot shot

This card is a good introduction to aspects, and can increase single target damage substantially because it can be applied to multiple sentries.

### Passive cooling

For the same reasons as blizzard, it is cheaper than [[#Hot shot]]. This can be very potent on and with AOE attacks/sentries, but on its own is underwhelming.
