## Starter cards

Overall, starter cards are fairly weak for their cost (both in draw and power) so that the player is encouraged to take more cards in their deck. It also teaches the main mechanics of the game, building, modifying buildings, and using attacks.

### Deploy sentry

Deploy 1 [[Buildings#Simple sentry]]

This serves as an introduction to building cards and buildings/sentries in general. They are also necessary to scale with the starter deck, as upgrades cannot function without them.

Artwork should just match the overall feel of the building.

### Upgrade

Apply 1 [[Status effects and aspects#Upgrade]]

This introduces upgrades and to an extent building status effects. Increased damage is augmented with the attack speed so it gets higher benefits every time. It does require a building in order to be useful, but since there is only two of them in the starter deck, the player is guaranteed to get at least 2 useful cards alongside it.

Artwork could be an arrow going up, or some kind of upgrade feeling aura around a sentry.

### Strike

Deal high damage in a small area

This card serves as a cheap damage card, along with [[#Blast]] it can help killing important targets faster or even instantly, can also prevent a few health lost if used on smaller enemies in the early rounds.

Artwork should convey the focused power of this attack. Lightning should not be used as it represents another mechanic (chaining).

### Blast

Deal medium damage in a large area.

This is generally more powerful than [[#Strike]] thanks to its increased radius, it helps a lot in the early rounds if there isn't enough firepower, being able to solo most of them.

Artwork should convey the scale of this attack.

## Building cards

These cards should have a bit more specialty (like applying stuff to the built sentry) but for now they are just a way to get other buildings.

- Explosive sentry ([[Buildings#Burst sentry]])
- Pulsing sentry ([[Buildings#Pulse sentry]])
- Long range sentry ([[Buildings#Sniper sentry]])

These cards' artworks should match the building they make.

## Status cards

These cards introduce status effects and sentry aspects.

### Blaze

Apply high amount of [[Status effects and aspects#Burn]] in a medium area

This can be an incredibly powerful attack if paired with other burn sources, and also is a good introduction to burn status effect.

A large fire or many burning enemies should both work as card artwork.

### Blizzard

Apply high amount of [[Status effects and aspects#Freeze]] in a medium area

This should introduce the slow mechanic and allow for some enemies to be heavily slowed down for a while. Because its effect isn't as strong as a [[#Blaze]], it is cheaper.

Artwork should be a blizzard.

## Aspect cards


### Hot shot

Apply [[Status effects and aspects#Fire]]

This card is a good introduction to aspects, and can increase single target damage substantially because it can be applied to multiple sentries.

Artwork should be a sentry shooting fire.

### Passive cooling

For the same reasons as blizzard, it is cheaper than [[#Hot shot]]. This can be very potent on and with AOE attacks/sentries, but on its own is underwhelming.

Artwork should be a sentry shooting snowy projectiles
