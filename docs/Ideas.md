Unorganized idea dump

Building special abilities at a certain level of upgrade (rare+ only maybe?)

Tech web, with "expertise", upgrades that last the whole run and can be acquired if adjacent to already acquired expertise. All expertises are always present on the web, but not in the same configuration. Deeper in the web there should be more expensive but more powerful and/or niche expertises. Expertises can be bought with expertise points.

Some cards could be a key to secret stuff. Could be extra content after the "end" in which case it should be guaranteed in a way, or side content that gives a bonus when completed.

	Making cards always somewhat useful on their own seems important.

## Building ideas

- Barrel sentry (very high fire rate, low damage and intensity, fires faster the longer it attacks)
- Sniper sentry (great range and damage and intensity, low fire rate)
- Burst sentry (fires AOE projectiles towards its target)
- Pulse sentry (deals damage in a radius around it)
- Aura/vent/wave sentry (like pulse sentry, but higher fire rate and good intensity, with very low DPS)
- Spray sentry (fires multiple projectiles, making it a good against weak grouped targets or large high HP enemies)
- Charge sentry (charges itself over time, and releases pent up charge all at once when an enemy shows up, excellent safety net but overall low sustained DPS)
- Switch sentry (has a weak mode that charges its other stronger mode)

- Power plant (generates power over time)
- Capacitor (stores power with low priority, gets used first, stores in last)
- Power duplicator (stores power, doubles it at the end of the round and gives it when broken)
- Library (pay power to draw a card)
- Knowledge keeper (store a card and use it on another turn)
- Laboratory (gives expertise points each round or at the end of the battle for each level)
- Beacon (applies all its buffs to other enemies)
