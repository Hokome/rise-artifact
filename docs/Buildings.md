This describes the buildings and their design.

## Sentries

Sentries are specifically towers that deal damage and can have an aspect.

### Simple sentry

Single target, average at everything except AOE, which it is mediocre at. This sentry is always in the starting deck. It has two main uses.

Early game they may be the only building available. They are also very cheap, making them good in the beginning of battles.

Spam, some cards should be focused on making many simple sentries efficiently and giving buffs to them such as [[Cards#Mass production]]

The simple sentry artwork should convey cheapness.

### Sniper sentry

High single target, and great range but the lowest fire rate of all sentries.

Art should convey the range with a long cannon but also the heaviness since it fires very powerful shots but slowly.

### Burst sentry

Shoots AOE projectiles, works well in straight line but isn't limited to them.

This should feel powerful and dangerous with a large canon.

### Pulse sentry

Deals damage around it, weak single target but great grouped damage and can work especially well with aspects.

Should convey the fast fire rate on top of the large area damage

### Spray sentry
### Barrel sentry
### Charge sentry
### Switch sentry

## Support

Support buildings cannot have aspects and aren't meant to deal damage on their own.
