This describes the buildings and their design.

## Sentries

Sentries are specifically towers that deal damage and can have an aspect.

### Simple sentry

Single target, average at everything except AOE, which it is mediocre at. This sentry is always in the starting deck. It has two main uses.

Early game they may be the only building available. They are also very cheap, making them good in the beginning of battles.

Spam, some cards should be focused on making many simple sentries efficiently and giving buffs to them such as [[Cards#Mass production]]
